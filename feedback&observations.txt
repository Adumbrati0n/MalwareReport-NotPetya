- Threat Intel Insights, Ukraine and globe section could be reworded better
- Less focus on API's, reword sentences better for easier understanding
- Not a dropper, main malware/ransomware
- Dont leave picture @ beginning of section
- Priv Esc - Not really priv esc, rename to acquiring priviledges
  - GetTickCount could be anti-analysis
  - Not using administrator for priv esc
- No need to mention CreateThread API in Network Enum as alot of malwares create threads and its pretty common
- Avoid API Names and description, focus on meaning behind API
- Resource Analysis could be simplified
  - Could put more info like 32/64-bit in the table and what RC does/is, simplifying wording w/o API's .... drops relevant resource, include RC name, desc in table
  - [x].tmp could be mimikatz for credential theft as a component i could analyse later on, could search for MD5
  - Avoid unlocking RT_RCDATA in mem, avoid API names/technical jargon
- Expand on rundll32.exe if can in Remote exec part
- AES GEN key could be explained/reworded better without importing/exporting jargon
- CryptDestroyKey --> Could just say destroy's key in memory
- Put Destroy MBR between ransom and encryption section
- Anti-analysis could be more anti-forensics/obfuscation
- In yara sig, may not need to include pub key in detection as there might be a different ver of same malware w/ diff pub key
